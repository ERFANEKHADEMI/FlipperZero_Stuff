## Firmware

### Official
[Flipper Zero Official](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware)

### Third Party
[Unleashed Firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware)
- Most stable custom firmware focused on new features and improvements of original firmware components, with almost no UI changes

[Flipper Xtreme](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme)
- The goal of this Firmware is to regularly bring out amazing updates based on what the community wants, with an actual understanding of whats going on. Fixing bugs that are regularly talked about, removing unstable / broken applications (.FAP) and actually using the level system that just sits abandoned everywhere else.

[Rouge Master](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins)
 - This firmware is a fork of Unleashed and the main Flipper Devices FW
